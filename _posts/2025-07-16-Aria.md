[Project Aria](https://www.projectaria.com/) is a research initiative led by Meta Reality Labs aiming to develop next-generation augmented reality technologies. Through our academic partnership with Meta Reality Labs, we are currently developing an Egocentric Multimodal AI Agent leveraging Project Aria’s advanced wearable device, Aria Glass. By integrating real-time visual streams from cameras, Visual SLAM for precise spatial understanding, and sophisticated eye-tracking data, this collaboration seeks to enable context-aware, personalized AI interactions. Our goal is to explore how multimodal AI can interpret and seamlessly respond to users’ real-world environments, providing foundational insights for future AR and wearable computing applications.
