We are delighted to announce that our workshop proposal to ICCV 2025 got approved!

The Workshop on Cultural Continuity of Artists (WCCA) brings together researchers, creators, and cultural institutions to explore how computer vision, multimodal AI, and XR technologies can safeguard and reinterpret artistic legacies. Our inaugural edition, co‑located with ICCV 2025, highlights the visionary South Korean fashion designer André Kim and introduces a rich, newly curated dataset from his archives.
