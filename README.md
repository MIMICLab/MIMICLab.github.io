# MIMIC Website


This repository contains the source for the MIMIC Lab website. The site is built
with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the
[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. The
`jekyll-seo-tag` plugin is included to provide basic SEO metadata.

   ```

   The CI workflow automatically upgrades RubyGems to 3.3.22 before
   building so that all gems install cleanly.

Site configuration lives in `_config.yml` and navigation links can be adjusted in `_data/navigation.yml`.
